# Ansible
- Ansible is an open source automation engine use for **configuration management**.

- Ansible uses simple and human-readable scripts called Playbooks to automate the tasks.

- **Playbooks**, which define automation workflows, are written in YAML.

- Ansible has agentless architecture, meaning Ansible does not require any software or agents to be installed on the target systems. It uses **SSH to communicate** and do the required task.

- Ansible ensures that the task and executed in the way that it does not alter the system if its already in the desired state. This prevents unintended charges **(Idempotency)**
